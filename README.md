# My Note App

My Note App is a simple web application that allows users to create, manage, and search for notes. This project is built using React and provides a user-friendly interface for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting notes.

## Features

- **Add Note:** Users can input and save new notes, and the note content is cleared from the input field upon submission.

- **View Notes:** All saved notes are displayed as individual cards in a list, with the newest notes appearing at the top.

- **Delete Note:** Users can easily delete unwanted notes by clicking a delete button associated with each note.

- **Edit Note (Bonus):** Optionally, users can edit existing notes. Notes can be clicked to enter an edit mode where users can make changes and save them.

- **Search Note (Bonus):** Users can quickly find specific notes by using a search bar at the top of the notes list. The list filters in real-time based on the user's search query.

- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be usable on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout adjusts to fit various screen sizes.

- **Error Handling and User Feedback:** The app provides user feedback and manages unforeseen errors. Notifications alert users of failed note additions or deletions, and loading indicators are displayed when the app processes data or awaits a response.
